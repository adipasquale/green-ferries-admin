      This data was scraped from <a href='directferries.fr'>directferries.fr</a>.
      You can find the puppeteer crawlers code on this <a href='https://github.com/greenferries/greenferries-scrapers'>GitHub repository</a>.
      The results were not incredibly satisfying but gave a decent base to populate the ship routes in GreenFerries.
      Most of the routes have been inserted manually after however.
