## first annual EU report on CO2 emissions from maritime transport

Published on 25/05/2020, downloadable from [ec.europa.eu/clima](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/commission-publishes-first-annual-eu-report-co2-emissions-maritime-transport_en).

This report analyses the 2019 figures reported in the THETIS system. 2019 being the first annual reporting period, some of this report concerns how THETIS was setup, and how well the ship operators managed to monitor and report their data.

It is mostly focused on the impact of Container and Bulk Carrier ships, because they account for the largest part of the monitored fleet (cf [Ship Types](/doc/ship_types)). About these ships they make one very interesting remark: **Container ships emit much more CO₂ per ton of freight per km than bulk carriers because they navigate much faster**.

About passenger ferries, this graph is interesting:

![graph of CO₂ emissions from different ship types and number of ships - first annual report on CO2 emissions from maritime transport](/img/eu-report-2019-graph-co2-emissions-per-ship-type.png)

The dotted blue line and figures represnets the number of ships, whereas the bars represent the CO₂ emissions.

The ratio of CO₂ emissions/number of ships seems very high for the ferries in that graph. **In 2019 in europe, an average Ro-pax ship emitted 10 times as much CO₂ than a bulk carrier**.

- Ro-pax means a ferry that carries both cars and passengers
- Bulk carrier means a shop that carries cargo in bulk (raw liquids, grains...), as opposed to Container ships
